S. Lewis** is best known for The Chronicles of Narnia, a classic fantasy series with magical worlds, adventure, and deep themes—very much in line with Tim’s stated preferences.\n\n**John Greene** (likely referring to John Green) writes contemporary young adult novels (e.g., The Fault in Our Stars, Looking for Alaska) that focus more on real-life issues, relationships, and personal growth. While Tim does enjoy books on growth and psychology, his primary passion is for fantasy and magical worlds.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Tim would almost certainly enjoy books by C. S. Lewis.\n- Tim might appreciate some of John Green’s books for their insights on growth and self-improvement, but they are not as closely aligned with his main love for fantasy literature.",
