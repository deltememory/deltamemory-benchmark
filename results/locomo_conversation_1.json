Bringing others comfort and helping them grow brings me such joy.\"\n- Caroline also notes: \"I saw how counseling and support groups improved my life, so I started caring more about mental health and understanding myself.

There is no direct mention of Caroline practicing a religion, attending religious services, or expressing religious beliefs.

The necklace stands for love, faith, and strength for Caroline, and reminds her of her roots and the love and support she receives from her family.\n- Caroline has encountered negative experiences with religious conservatives (e.g., during a hike in 2023, a group of religious conservatives said something that upset her).\n\nWhile the cross necklace may indicate some connection to Christian symbolism or family tradition, there is no evidence that Caroline actively practices a religion or identifies as religious. The context suggests that the necklace is more about personal meaning (love, faith, strength, family roots) than organized religion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCaroline would not be considered religious based on the available information.
